## Features

- Fetches the latest NASA APOD daily
- Handles both image and video content types
- Sends formatted MMS messages with media
- Includes title, explanation, and copyright information
- Scheduled to run once per day

## Prerequisites

1. **NASA API Key**
   - Get a free API key from [NASA API Portal](https://api.nasa.gov/)
   - Add it to your `.env` file as `NASA_API_KEY`

2. **Twilio Account**
   - Sign up at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)
   - Add the following to your `.env` file:

     ```bash
     TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
     TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SECRET=your_auth_token
     ```

   - Get a Twilio phone number with MMS capabilities

## Setup

1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance
2. Update the following in the workflow:
   - Twilio "From" phone number
   - Recipient "To" phone number
   - **Important**: Manually update the Twilio Account SID in the HTTP request nodes (both "Send MMS" and "Send Video MMS") as the workflow currently can't read it from credentials
3. Ensure your Twilio credentials are set up in n8n
4. The workflow is scheduled to run daily, but you can trigger it manually for testing
